A Comparative Study between Heuristic Task Scheduling and Optimization-Based Algorithms in Cloud Computing Environments

#--------------- Compared Algorithms -------------
* Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
* Round Robin Algorithm        (RR)
* Shortest Job First          (SJF)
* First Come First Serve      (FCFS)


#------- Performance Metrics -------

1- Makespan
2- Average Completion Time
3- Average Waiting Time

#----------- Settings:

# of VMs: 20 , Homogeneous VMs
Timesharing policy is used for both host-level and task-level

PSO population size= 25 Particles
PSO iterations: 500
PSO objective: minimize(makespan)
